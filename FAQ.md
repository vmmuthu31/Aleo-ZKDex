## I had an error installing snarkOS on Windows

`` error: failed to run custom build command for `librocksdb-sys v0.11.0+8.1.1 ``

When trying to install `snarkOS` on a Windows machine, please follow these instructions

1. Install LLVM via the .exe download here https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-16.0.0
2. Add LLVM to the PATH, verify you can use `clang` in the terminal or powershell
3. clone SnarkOS repository: `git clone https://github.com/AleoHQ/snarkOS`

## I had an error when trying to use `leo run`

`Error: Function 'mint' in the program 'token_13579.aleo' expects 1 inputs, but 0 inputs were found.`

If you encounter this error, it happens most commonly because you have a syntax error in your input file. Make sure that all inputs are followed by a semi-colon, including objects. Here is an example

```
[my_leo_function]
receiver: address = aleo1c55rzshzjm6xqdaz3xqsd6fj2ysqkhdl8y6xsn29a48vyvgzj58qrg6pwd;
amount: u32 = 10u32;
input: Object = Object {
  owner: aleo1u4fx4m9aflyanm56h5vv45xangr3vvfdq96eqrapa22h60e8ngqsjdt8j5,
  balance: 100u32,
  _nonce: 1254471947785662395092980351949765066082396412055480960193555787900641209591group
};
```

## I had an error when running the `deploy.sh` script

```
üì¶ Creating deployment transaction for 'token.aleo'...

‚ö†Ô∏è  Fee record does not have enough balance to pay the fee
```

This error is caused when your package name is not unique.

The Aleo Package repository requires globally unique names.
Change your package name to something unique and try again after updating the name of the following:

1. Package name generated by `leo new <package_name>`
2. File name of the `<package_name>.in` input file
3. Progam name within `leo.main` file
4. Progam name within within `leo.aleo` file
5. Update `APPNAME` in the `deploy.sh` script to your new package name
6. Update the `progam_name` field within `package.json` file to your new package name
